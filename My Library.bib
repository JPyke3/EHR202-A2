  abstract = {Australian Indigenous people continue to experience low economic independence and acknowledged social dislocations believed to be underpinned by unattractive levels of participation in the labour market. Recent legal developments provide foundation for mining operators, the Australian governments, and Indigenous traditional owners to negotiate land-use agreements that feature commitment to deliver greater training and employment prospects for Aboriginal people. However, aspirations of Australian Indigenous people, who are deficient in written English expression, to obtain entry to new mainstream jobs are seriously curbed when confronted with recruitment processes requiring competencies in English reading and writing skills. In this paper is reported an assessment of an innovative recruitment process, devoid of the need to demonstrate English literacy skills, for Indigenous people seeking mainstream jobs in the mining sector. The relative features of the scheme are discussed in the context of a multinational mining company operating in northern Australia.},

  abstract = {Issue: Although each research location (regional, rural and remote) has had to spend time determining what approach is best for meeting the research outcomes, many of these suggestions become applicable to clinicians seeking to develop better connections with Aboriginal patients in their clinics. With the management of ongoing chronic health conditions for Aboriginal people a priority in `Closing the Gap', a number of these suggestions could easily be implemented by clinicians. Remembering that each community has specific needs that must be addressed, priorities for assistance for that community will be easily identifiable after community consultation (eg transport, or ability to access medical testing). Opportunities for the use of new social media (eg Facebook) as communication tools for researchers and clinicians will have increasing applicability as further software updates are created. Lessons learnt: With open and trusting dialogues between researchers, clinicians and Aboriginal communities, we can go a long way towards understanding the needs of individual communities and working in partnerships to close the gap.},
