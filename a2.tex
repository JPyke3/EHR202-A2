\section{Introduction}
In the dynamic landscape of Human Resource Management (HRM), the strategic imperative to cultivate a diverse and inclusive workforce remains paramount. Amidst this backdrop, this report delves into the nuanced sphere of recruitment as it pertains to two distinct diversity groups: Indigenous Australians and older workers. Recognizing the former's rich cultural heritage and the latter's vast reservoirs of experience and wisdom, the report examines traditional and modern recruitment methodologies through a critical lense to unearth inherent biases and barriers that potentially impede the participation of these groups. By synthesizing the latest scholarly insights and empirical evidence, this analysis endeavors not only to spotlight systemic challenges but also to forge robust recommendations capable of sculpting equitable recruitment landscapes. Such refinements aim to not only enhance the fabric of organizational practice but align it with the evolving ethos of equality and opportunity in the Australian workforce.

\section{Literature Review and Analysis for Indigenous Australians}
According to \cite{pearsonExtendingBoundariesHuman2011}, the socioeconomic status of Indigenous Australians can only be described as disadvantaged. \cite{podgerEnduringChallengesNew2017} goes further to state that Indigenous Australians are currently in a state of "Poverty Crisis". They are a people that are Land Rich and Cash Poor \parencite{podgerEnduringChallengesNew2017}. Further, Indigenous Australians are more likely to suffer from lower life expectency \parencite{leederAchievingEquityAustralian2003}, less likely to access services if they have a disability \parencite{statisticsChapterDisability2011}, and more likely to be bullied in school \parencite{coffinBullyingAboriginalContext2010}. \cite{rynesImportanceRecruitmentJob1991} explains that recruitment active recruitment is highly important for job choice and will positively impact the business. Despite this, \cite{pearsonExtendingBoundariesHuman2011} goes on to describe as modern recruitment being traditional and not at all geared to assist in the recruiement of indigeneous australians.
